## Overview
The `Flexingg/core/migrations/` directory contains Django migration files tracking schema evolution. There are 6 migrations (0001 to 0006), starting from initial models to adding fitness fields like height/weight. Each file is generated by Django and applies changes via operations (CreateModel, AddField, AlterField, etc.). Run with `python manage.py migrate`. Dependencies ensure order. Key themes: initial user/gear/workout, Garmin integration, social features, sweat score, physical attributes.
